# Raspberry Pi Zero W - NodeJS
**Originally created by [sdesalas](https://github.com/sdesalas/node-pi-zero/)**, this version of their repository contains new versions of NodeJS. All of their **.sh** code has been ***yoinked***, so please support the original creator.

Please keep in mind that the NodeJS team stopped support for the **ARMv6** chip, therefore making **EVERY** latest version after v12 classified as **experimental** for any system using the Armv6 chip.
